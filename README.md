# 💠 Polybar Themes – Custom Status Bars for Arch Linux

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A curated collection of personal Polybar configuration themes, refined over time on my Arch Linux setup. These aren't just configs—they're the result of hands-on Linux sysadmin tinkering: optimizing modules for performance, integrating media controls, and adapting layouts for different hardware. As I've leveled up my dotfiles game (think pacman deep dives, i3wm integrations, and font tweaks), these themes have evolved into lightweight, modular setups adapted to my workflow.
